- Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:
- Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:
  - If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
  - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
- The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.
- After you are done **modifying the input array,** return *the new length of the array*.
- You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1**

```
Input: chars = [ "a","a","b","b","c","c","c" ]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [ "a","2","b","2","c","3" ]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: chars = [ "a" ]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: [ "a" ]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: chars = [ "a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b" ]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: [ "a","b","1","2" ].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```
