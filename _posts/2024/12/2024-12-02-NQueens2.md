- The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
- Given an integer `n`, return *the number of distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle***.

**Example 1**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

## Method 1
