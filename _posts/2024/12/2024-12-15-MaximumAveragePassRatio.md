- There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]`. You know beforehand that in the `ith` class, there are `totali` total students, but only `passi` number of students will pass the exam.

- You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are **guaranteed** to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that **maximizes** the **average** pass ratio across **all** the classes.

- The **pass ratio** of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The **average pass ratio** is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

  Return *the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning the* `extraStudents` *students.* Answers within 10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1**

```
Input: classes = [ [ 1,2],[3,5],[2,2 ] ], extraStudents = 2
Output: 0.78333
Explanation: You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: classes = [ [ 2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10 ] ], extraStudents = 4
Output: 0.53485
```
