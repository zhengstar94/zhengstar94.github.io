title: "1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences"

- Given a string `s`, return *the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of* `s`.
- Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.
- A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
- A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
  - For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

**Example 1**

```
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
```
