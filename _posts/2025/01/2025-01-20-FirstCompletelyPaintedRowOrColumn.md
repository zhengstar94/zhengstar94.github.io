- You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `arr`, and an `m x n` integer **matrix** `mat`. `arr` and `mat` both contain **all** the integers in the range `[1, m * n]`.
- Go through each index `i` in `arr` starting from index `0` and paint the cell in `mat` containing the integer `arr[i]`.
- Return *the smallest index* `i` *at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in* `mat`.

**Example 1**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,4,2], mat = [ [ 1,4],[2,3 ] ]
Output: 2
Explanation: The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at arr[2].
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: arr = [2,8,7,4,1,3,5,6,9], mat = [ [ 3,2,5],[1,4,6],[8,7,9 ] ]
Output: 3
Explanation: The second column becomes fully painted at arr[3].
```
