- You are given a digit string `s` that consists of digits from 0 to 9.
- A string is called **semi-repetitive** if there is **at most** one adjacent pair of the same digit. For example, `"0010"`, `"002020"`, `"0123"`, `"2002"`, and `"54944"` are semi-repetitive while the following are not: `"00101022"` (adjacent same digit pairs are 00 and 22), and `"1101234883"` (adjacent same digit pairs are 11 and 88).
- Return the length of the **longest semi-repetitive substring** of `s`.

**Example 1**

```
Input: s = "52233"
Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest semi-repetitive substring is "5223". Picking the whole string "52233" has two adjacent same digit pairs 22 and 33, but at most one is allowed.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: s = "5494"
Output: 4

Explanation:

s is a semi-repetitive string.
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: s = "1111111"
Output: 2

Explanation:

The longest semi-repetitive substring is "11". Picking the substring "111" has two adjacent same digit pairs, but at most one is allowed.
```
