- You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `ith` tree produces.
- You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
  - You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
  - Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
  - Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
- Given the integer array `fruits`, return *the **maximum** number of fruits you can pick*.

**Example 1**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```
