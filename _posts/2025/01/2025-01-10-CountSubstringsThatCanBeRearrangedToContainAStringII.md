title: "3298. Count Substrings That Can Be Rearranged to Contain a String II"

---

- You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`.
- A string `x` is called **valid** if `x` can be rearranged to have `word2` as a prefix.
- Return the total number of **valid** substrings of `word1`.
- **Note** that the memory limits in this problem are **smaller** than usual, so you **must** implement a solution with a *linear* runtime complexity.

**Example 1**

```
Input: nums = [90], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
