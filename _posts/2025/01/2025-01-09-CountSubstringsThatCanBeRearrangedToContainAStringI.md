- You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`.
- A string `x` is called **valid** if `x` can be rearranged to have `word2` as a prefix.
- Return the total number of **valid** substrings of `word1`.

**Example 1**

```
Input: word1 = "bcca", word2 = "abc"
Output: 1

Explanation:

The only valid substring is "bcca" which can be rearranged to "abcc" having "abc" as a prefix.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abc"
Output: 10

Explanation:

All the substrings except  substrings of size 1 and size 2 are valid.
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "aaabc"

Output: 0
```
