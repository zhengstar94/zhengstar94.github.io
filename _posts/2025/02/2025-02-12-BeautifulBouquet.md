- At the LeetCode Carnival's flower shop, flowers are arranged in a row from left to right, recorded in an integer array `flowers` where each number represents the variety ID of the flower at that position. You can select a continuous segment of flowers to make a floral arrangement, and no flowers can be discarded. In your chosen arrangement, if the quantity of each flower variety does not exceed `cnt` flowers, then we consider this floral arrangement to be "aesthetically pleasing."

  > For example: In `[5,5,5,6,6]`, there are `3` flowers of variety `5` and `2` flowers of variety `6`. The quantity of **each variety** does not exceed `3`.

- Return the total number of possible continuous segments that can be selected from this row of flowers where the resulting floral arrangement would be "aesthetically pleasing."

- Note:

  - The answer should be calculated modulo `1e9 + 7 (1000000007)`. For example, if the initial result is `1000000008`, return `1`.

**Example 1**

```
Let me translate this example with its explanation:
Input: flowers = [1,2,3,2], cnt = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: For arrangements where each flower variety cannot exceed 1 flower, there are 8 aesthetically pleasing arrangements:
Length-1 segments: [1], [2], [3], [2] all meet the condition, giving 4 possible segments
Length-2 segments: [1,2], [2,3], [3,2] all meet the condition, giving 3 possible segments
Length-3 segments: [1,2,3] meets the condition, giving 1 possible segment
Segments [2,3,2] and [1,2,3,2] both contain 2 flowers of variety 2, so they don't meet the condition.
Total count is 4+3+1 = 8
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: flowers = [5,3,3,3], cnt = 2
Output: 8
```
