- Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
- Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.
- Given the positions of `houses` and `heaters` on a horizontal line, return *the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.***
- **Notice** that all the `heaters` follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

**Example 1**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heaters were placed at positions 1 and 4. We need to use a radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
Output: 3
```
