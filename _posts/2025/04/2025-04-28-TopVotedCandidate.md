- You are given two integer arrays `persons` and `times`. In an election, the `ith` vote was cast for `persons[i]` at time `times[i]`.
- For each query at a time `t`, find the person that was leading the election at time `t`. Votes cast at time `t` will count towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.
- Implement the `TopVotedCandidate` class:
  - `TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)` Initializes the object with the `persons` and `times` arrays.
  - `int q(int t)` Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t` according to the mentioned rules.


**Example 1**

```
Input
["TopVotedCandidate", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q"]
[[[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]], [3], [12], [25], [15], [24], [8]]
Output
[null, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TopVotedCandidate topVotedCandidate = new TopVotedCandidate([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]);
topVotedCandidate.q(3); // return 0, At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(12); // return 1, At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(25); // return 1, At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
topVotedCandidate.q(15); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(24); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(8); // return 1
```
