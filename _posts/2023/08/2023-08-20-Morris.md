# Morris traversal of binary Tree

## Conception
1. Nodes without left subtrees will only arrive once, and nodes with left subtrees will arrive twice.
2. The use of the tree's leaf nodes around the child is empty (a large number of free pointers of the tree), so as to achieve a rapid reduction in space overhead.

### Explain
> The node uses the right pointer direction of the rightmost node on the left tree to mark whether it is the first or second time.<br>
>   1. If this is the first time you mark yourself, move to the left and use the same strategy to execute the subtree (left tree).
>   2. If it is the second time to mark yourself, after the recovery is complete, go to the right subtree to repeat the behavior (1,2).

1. The node has no left tree and the node only arrives once.
   - If the rightmost node of the left subtree of a node points to empty, the node must be coming for the first time.
2. The node has a left tree and the node arrives twice.
   - If the rightmost node of the left subtree of the current node points to itself, the node must be coming for the second time.


## Details
Suppose the current node cur, and the cur comes to the header node at the beginning.
1. If cur does not have a left child, cur moves to the right, `cur = cur.right`.
2. If cur has a left child, find the rightmost node morrisRight of the left subtree.
   1. If the right pointer of morrisRight points to null, let it point to cur, and then cur moves to the left, `cur = cur.left`.
   2. If the right pointer of morrisRight points to cur, let it point to null, and then cur moves to the right, `cur = cur.right`.
3. Cur is null and traversing stops.

## Logic

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/2023/08/20/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true width="70%"%}

**Recursive order: ①②②②①③③③① [System stack]**

Pre-order (the result of the first occurrence): ①②③ <br>
Middle order (the result of the second occurrence): ②①③ <br>
Post-order (the result of the third occurrence): ②③① <br>

### Morris traversal highly simulates recursive behavior
1. There is no left subtree node and can only be reached once.
2. There are left subtree nodes, which can reach 2 times.
3. The node cannot be reached 3 times.
> Morris uses `a node to point the right pointer to the left tree` to solve this problem.

            cur = cur.right;
        }
    }
}
```

### In-order traversal

>   1. The direct output of the node that can only reach itself once
>   2. Nodes that can reach themselves twice only print the second time.

        }
    }
}

### Post-order traversal
> Post-order traversal is the third visit before printing.
>   1. Morris traversal there is no third visit.
>   2. The Post-order can only care about the node that goes back to itself twice.
       >      1. Skip the node that you can reach once.
>      2. For the node that you can reach twice
          >         1. When the second traversal arrives, `the right boundary of the current left subtree is printed in reverse order`.
>         2. After traversing, `you finally need to print the right boundary of the whole tree in reverse order`.
